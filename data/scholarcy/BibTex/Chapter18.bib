Factors influencing feasibility are context-dependent, temporally dynamic, and may vary between different groups and actors. Feasibility depends on geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors that enable or constrain the implementation of an option. The feasibility of options may change when different options are combined, and increase when enabling conditions are strengthened. Twenty-two key adaptation options have been identified in AR6, across these system transitions, and mapped against representative key risks at global scale (Chapter 16},
